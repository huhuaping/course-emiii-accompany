Here, we just ignore the omitted ability problem.\n\n### The reduced equations\n\n$$\n\\begin{alignedat}{8}\n\\text { hours } & =\\pi_{10}+\\pi_{11} { educ }+\\pi_{12} age+\\pi_{13}  { kidslt6 }  +\\pi_{14} { nwifeinc }\\\\\n&+\\pi_{15} { exper }  +\\pi_{16} {exper}^2 +v_1  \\\\\n \\log ({ wage }) &=\\pi_{20}+\\pi_{21} { educ }+\\pi_{22} age+\\pi_{23}  { kidslt6 }  +\\pi_{24} { nwifeinc } \\\\\n &+\\pi_{25} { exper }  +\\pi_{26} {exper}^2+ v_2\n\\end{alignedat}\n$$\n\n## Reproducible Sources\n\n**Wooldridge, J.M.

Understand the nature of `SEM`.\n\nb. Know the steps of running TSLS method.\n\nc. Be familiar with R package function `systemfit::systemfit()`.\n\n## Exercise Materials \n\nYou can find all the exercise materials in this project under the file directory:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nD:/github/course-emiii-accompany/sem-wage-mroz\n└── code-sem-mroz.R\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::",
